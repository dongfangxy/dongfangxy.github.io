  operspec Create array of operating point specification objects
  You can now create an array of operating point specification objects using the operspec command. You can modify the individual specification objects based on your trimming requirements and batch-compute operating points using a single model compilation.
  For an example that uses an array of operating point specification objects, see Designing a Family of PID Controllers for Multiple Operating Points.
